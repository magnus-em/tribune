Newest first. One entry per tick. Counts only — no names, emails, addresses, or
per-case amounts.

## 2026-10-28 — manual (Phase 0 kickoff) — plan approved, foundation laid
- Did: Magnus approved PLAN.md and the charter. Rewrote the stale letter and intake
  tests (21 failing → 64 passing) so they guard the legal invariants: 2× full
  deposit, exact deadline dates, no attorney framing, payment to the tenant.
  Added GitHub Actions CI (it builds with placeholder env, verified locally with
  no `.env.local`). Replaced the "within a few hours" SLA with a `REVIEW_SLA`
  constant ("within two business days") in 6 places, and fixed one "We're
  reviewing" voice slip. Wrote CHARTER, LOOP, BACKLOG, ESCALATIONS, SETUP, the
  legal packet, metrics SQL, and the read-only role SQL.
- Learned: prod (usetribune.org) serves the June 11 code. `reply.usetribune.org`
  MX already points at Resend inbound, so the TASKS.md note about root-domain
  replies was stale. Prod DB reads are blocked by the permission classifier
  without a standing rule, so real usage is still unknown. The SLA copy change
  wasn't browser-verified: the authenticated pages need a test login, and with no
  staging that would mean writing to the prod DB. Found three letter defects (E-003).
- Next: the build tick takes BACKLOG "Now" #1 (doc drift). Everything needing
  access waits on E-001.
